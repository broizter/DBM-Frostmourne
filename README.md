**Archived repository** — this project is no longer maintained, as I am no longer playing on the Frostmourne server.  
The code remains available for anyone who wants to fork the project and continue development on their own.

**Timer accuracy:** Timers are mostly correct for Tier 7, 8, and 9 content.  
Tier 10 (Icecrown Citadel/Ruby Sanctum) still requires significant work and verification.

# DBM-Frostmourne (3.3.5a)
