# DBM-Frostmourne (3.3.5a)

Deadly Boss Mods that aims to implement accurate timers for Stormforge's Frostmourne server.

## Maintenance Status

Since I no longer play on the Frostmourne server, this project is not actively developed.  
That said, **reported bugs may still be investigated and fixed**, depending on scope and impact.

**Pull requests are very welcome**. Contributions are the best way to keep this project accurate and up to date.
