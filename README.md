Since I am no longer actively playing on the Frostmourne server, this DBM version will not see further work from me.  
Pull requests with sensible fixes will still be merged, although I highly recommend forking this repository instead.

Timers for tier 7, 8 and 9 should be mostly correct unless server side changes happen. ICC/Ruby Sanctum still needs significant work though.

# DBM-Frostmourne (3.3.5a)

Deadly Boss Mods that aims to implement accurate timers for the Frostmourne servers.
